      <h1>What are suggested uses of Generative AI for educators?</h1>
      <div class="byline">By Xiaojuan</div>
      <p>Generative AI has become a valuable support tool for educators who want to enhance their teaching materials, reduce preparation time, and offer more variety in classroom activities. While AI is not meant to replace an instructor’s professional judgment, it can significantly assist with idea generation, lesson development, and content drafting. Below are meaningful, appropriate ways educators, especially Communication instructors, can use AI effectively and ethically.</p>

      <h3>1. Activity Generation</h3>
      <p>AI can quickly generate warm-ups, writing prompts, short scenarios, discussion questions, or full role-play scripts tailored to a lesson topic. It helps produce multiple versions for different levels or needs, making activity generation the most practical use in Communication classes.</p>

      <h3>2. Lesson Warm-Ups and Writing Prompts</h3>
      <p>Create engaging warm-up questions or writing tasks targeted to skills like persuasive writing, summarizing, or critical thinking. Prompts can be adapted for ESL learners or higher-level groups.</p>

      <h3>3. Drafting Emails or Announcements</h3>
      <p>Use AI for first drafts of emails or class announcements such as reminders, assignment intros, clarifications. It saves time and ensures clarity, then you edit before sending.</p>

      <h3>4. Brainstorming Class Examples</h3>
      <p>Generate sample paragraphs, explanations, workplace scenarios, and alternative examples to illustrate concepts. Request simpler or more advanced versions to match student needs.</p>

      <h3>5. Summaries of Student Writing</h3>
      <p>Summarize student paragraphs to grasp main ideas quickly before giving feedback. AI should never grade, it only provides a quick overview to save time.</p>

      <h3>6. Creating Quiz Questions</h3>
      <p>Generate practice items: multiple-choice, comprehension checks, vocabulary, or true/false. These can be used in class or uploaded to tools like Quizlet or Kahoot.</p>

      <h3>Do’s and Don’ts</h3>
      <h4>Do</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Use AI to generate ideas and reduce preparation time.</li>
        <li>Adapt AI-generated materials for different learners (ESL, advanced).</li>
        <li>Always review, refine, and personalize AI outputs before class.</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Don’t</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Use AI to grade final assignments or make academic decisions.</li>
        <li>Copy AI-generated content directly without checking accuracy and appropriateness.</li>
        <li>Rely on a single prompt, iterate to improve quality.</li>
      </ul>
