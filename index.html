      <h1>Why AI matters for Communication instructors</h1>
      <div class="byline">By Jueun</div>
      <p>Teaching in the field of Communication often requires instructors to create new examples, in-class activities, discussion scenarios, and writing tasks on a regular basis. These tasks are essential for supporting student learning, but they also take a lot of time, especially when instructors are balancing lesson planning, marking, and classroom engagement.</p>
      <p>Generative AI tools such as ChatGPT can help lighten this workload by assisting instructors with idea generation, activity design, and content creation. Many Communication instructors are already exploring AI, but not all feel confident about where to begin or how to use it in a safe, effective way. This tutorial is designed to bridge that gap.</p>
      <p>In the following pages, we introduce practical ways that Communication instructors can use ChatGPT to create in-class activities quickly and efficiently. Our goal is not to replace your teaching expertise, but to show how AI can support it, saving preparation time, offering diverse examples, and making it easier to adapt activities for different learner needs.</p>
      <p>By the end of this tutorial, you will have a clear understanding of how to get started, how to write effective prompts, and how to use ChatGPT as a supportive tool to enhance student engagement in your Communication courses.</p>
