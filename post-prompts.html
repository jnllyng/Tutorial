      <h1>How to Write Effective Prompts</h1>
      <div class="byline">By Princess</div>
      <p>Writing effective prompts means giving AI clear, structured, and purposeful instructions, much like briefing a human collaborator. The more precise and detailed your prompt, the better and more usable the AI's output will be. The CREATE framework provides a reliable method to build strong prompts. Here's how you can apply it.</p>

      <h2><span class="highlight-red">C</span>haracter</h2>
      <p>A strong prompt begins by defining the role the AI should adopt. Giving AI a role shapes the perspective, tone, and expertise it uses. For example, asking it to act as a Communication instructor, an ESL specialist, or a writing tutor will produce very different results. Setting a role helps the AI understand the expectations and approach appropriate for the task.</p>

      <h2><span class="highlight-red">R</span>equest</h2>
      <p>The next step is to make a clear request. Instead of giving short or vague commands, describe exactly what you want the AI to produce. This includes the purpose of the activity, the topic, the intended students, and the type of output you expect. A well-defined request reduces ambiguity and guides the AI to create something relevant and purposeful for your lesson.</p>

      <h2><span class="highlight-red">E</span>xamples</h2>
      <p>Including examples whether it is a sample paragraph, a preferred writing style, or the structure you want, helps the AI understand what “good” looks like. Examples serve as models that define tone, format, difficulty, and level of detail. When the AI can see or imitate a pattern, it can match your expectations more accurately.</p>

      <h2><span class="highlight-red">A</span>djustments / Constraints</h2>
      <p>Constraints are additional instructions that refine the output. These may specify the length of the text, the reading level, the tone, or whether the language should be simple for ESL learners. Constraints help tailor the result to your students’ needs. They also prevent the AI from producing overly long or complicated content that requires heavy editing.</p>

      <h2><span class="highlight-red">T</span>ype of Output</h2>
      <p>Telling the AI what form the final product should take ensures that it produces something immediately usable. You can request a paragraph, list, table, quiz, role-play script, reflection question, or set of instructions. When the output form is clearly defined, the result becomes easier to plug into a lesson plan or classroom activity.</p>

      <h2><span class="highlight-red">E</span>xtras</h2>
      <p>Extras include any additional conditions or features that might improve the output. This could be asking for alternative versions, including a follow-up task, simplifying the wording, or checking for clarity. Extras help the AI anticipate additional needs you may have and allow for flexibility in how the output can be used.</p>

      <h2>CREATE Framework in Action</h2>
      <p>Here is an example of a complete prompt that uses all elements of the CREATE framework:</p>
      <p><i>"Act as a Communication instructor who teaches first-year ESL students. Create a 15-minute warm-up discussion activity about workplace communication. Include one short scenario, two discussion questions, and one optional writing extension. Use clear and simple English suitable for ESL learners. Present the final output in a list format and provide one alternative version for higher-level students."</i></p>
      <p>This example shows how a well-structured prompt helps AI deliver exactly what you need with minimal editing.</p>
