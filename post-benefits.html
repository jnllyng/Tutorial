      <h2>Benefits for Students</h2>
      <p>AI prompting gives students access to personalized explanations, creative ideas, and immediate support that can strengthen their confidence and independence as learners.</p>

      <h4>1. Improves Learning Efficiency</h4>
      <p>Students can receive instant explanations in multiple formats, simplified, advanced, visual descriptions, or practical examples, helping them understand difficult concepts faster at their own pace.</p>

      <h4>2. Enhances Assignment and Project Quality</h4>
      <p>AI can help students brainstorm ideas, build outlines, revise writing, or debug code. It acts as a study partner that guides them step-by-step toward stronger assignments and better problem-solving.</p>

      <h4>3. Encourages Independent Learning</h4>
      <p>Because students can ask AI questions at any time, they become less dependent on instructors for every clarification, supporting self-directed learning, curiosity, and problem-solving skills.</p>

      <h4>4. Supports Struggling or ESL Learners</h4>
      <p>AI can re-teach concepts in different ways: simplifying language, breaking instructions into steps, or offering extra examples, making learning more accessible to those who need added support.</p>

      <h4>5. Boosts Creativity and Innovation</h4>
      <p>AI provides new ideas, design concepts, sample dialogues, diagrams, story starters, and problem-solving approaches, encouraging students to think beyond traditional assignment structures.</p>

      <h2>Benefits for Instructors</h2>
      <p>For instructors, AI prompting functions as a practical assistant that helps reduce cognitive load, increase productivity, and support professional growth.</p>

      <h4>1. Saves Time on Repetitive Tasks</h4>
      <p>AI can quickly generate drafts of quizzes, assignment descriptions, sample answers, lesson summaries, rubrics, or class examples. This reduces the time spent on routine preparation and allows instructors to focus more on teaching and supporting students.</p>

      <h4>2. Helps Personalize Teaching</h4>
      <p>AI can produce simplified explanations for struggling learners, more advanced tasks for higher-level students, or differentiated examples based on class needs. This helps instructors deliver more inclusive lessons without dramatically increasing workload.</p>

      <h4>3. Enhances Feedback Quality</h4>
      <p>AI can support instructors by helping create feedback drafts or suggesting ways to reword comments constructively. While instructors must always review and personalize the final feedback, AI helps reduce fatigue and maintain consistency when responding to large groups of students.</p>

      <h4>4. Improves Classroom Engagement</h4>
      <p>By incorporating AI-powered activities such as discussion prompts, role-plays, or creative tasks, teachers can make lessons more interactive. Students often participate more enthusiastically when activities are varied and tailored to their interests.</p>

      <h4>5. Supports Professional Development</h4>
      <p>AI can assist instructors with staying current in their field, exploring innovative teaching methods, analyzing examples of communication strategies, or learning about emerging technologies. This helps educators grow professionally and remain adaptable in a rapidly changing educational environment.</p>
